### About Me

Hello! I'm Robin, a data scientist currently located in Washington DC. I graduated from Dartmouth College in June 2019 with a degree in Mathematics. I love podcasts, adventure cycling, and <a href="https://www.robinzen.com/animations" target="_blank">hand-drawing animations</a>. 


### About My Website

The current goal of my website (besides <a href="https://www.robinzen.com/resume" target="_blank">blatant self-promotion</a>) is to spread knowledge. I'll be sharing projects I'm working on and step-by-step guides meant for anybody to be able to follow. As I continue to build out this site, I might have a better focus for the projects I share, but for now, I hope you enjoy the eclecticism! 


### My Other Projects

* Co-authored <a href="https://journals.calstate.edu/pump/article/view/1920/2044" target="_blank">*Diplomatic Dynamics of International Treaty Negotiations*</a>, an epidemiological approach to multi-party negotiations
* Co-founded <a href="https://www.whereimreallyfrom.com" target="_blank">Where I'm Really From</a>, an online archive of Asian-American narratives
* Co-hosted <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2VnJjutE1eQ2aTnccDaAPy" target="_blank">Asian American Brainstorm</a>, a podcast dedicated to telling the story of major Asian American figures.
