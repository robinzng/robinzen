### About Me

Hello! I'm Robin, a data scientist currently located in Philly. I graduated from Dartmouth College in June 2019 with a degree in Mathematics. I love community building, adventure cycling, and hand-drawing animations. 


### About My Website

The current goal of my website (besides <a href="https://www.robinzen.com/resume" target="_blank">blatant self-promotion</a>) is to spread knowledge. I'll be sharing projects I'm working on and step-by-step guides meant for anybody to be able to follow. The projects will range from the <a href="https://www.robinzen.com/how-to-build-a-free-website" target="_blank">very creation of this website</a> to <a href="https://www.robinzen.com/the-math-of-camel-up" target="_blank">math papers on board game strategies</a>. As I continue to build out this site, I might have a better focus for the projects I share, but for now, I hope you enjoy the eclecticism! 


### My Other Projects

* Co-authored <a href="https://journals.calstate.edu/pump/article/view/1920/2044" target="_blank">*Diplomatic Dynamics of International Treaty Negotiations*</a>, an epidemiological approach to multi-party negotiations
* Co-founded <a href="https://www.whereimreallyfrom.com" target="_blank">Where I'm Really From</a>, an online archive of Asian-American narratives
