### I designed a logo (AKA hire me for all your logo needs!)

#### Ambling preamble
My good buddy <a href="https://www.afnan.io" target="_blank">Afnan</a> created this badass tool called <a href="https://github.com/afnanenayet/diffsitter" target="_blank">Diffsitter</a> that creates more helpful diffs. He also wanted us to learn how to make vector graphics together so we could create a logo for Diffsitter. 

So we did! For free! 

#### How I did it
To do so, I used the open-source painting program <a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank">Krita</a>. All you need to do to create a vector graphic within Krita is to add a vector layer (in the dropdown next to the plus sign within the "Layer" dock). Then use the different polygon drawing tools to make shapes, lines, etc. Super easy!  

Since his program is called "Diffsitter," I brainstormed a bunch of different potential logos that involved either the concept of diffs or the concept of sitting. This included: deltas, chairs, stools, benches. Clearly sitting was slightly easier for me to visualize. 

From there, I drew and redrew different logos that incorporated these concepts. One was just the word "Diffsitter," but with the D shaped more like the Greek delta. One was the word sitting on a very long bench. Another was a sleeker "Diffsitter" where the tiddles over the i's and the crosses through the f's and t's were all connected. 

But the winner was... a little chair :> 

#### Things I love about this little chair: 
* Look how cute it is! 
* It's also very minimalist and clean, which is exactly in line with Afnan's aesthetic (this required a bit of back and forth, since minimalism is not my go-to)
* It's shaped like a d, for Diffsitter
* The red and green symbolize unresolved and resolved diffs
* SO FRIKKEN CUTE (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

So that's the journey! I've learned a lot about creating vector graphics, and would love to design more things - I really enjoyed the process of not only drawing the logo, but also iterating on it to make it as perfect as possible. Hire me!
