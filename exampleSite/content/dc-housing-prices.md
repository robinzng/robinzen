### Housing Prices in Washington, D.C.

Little life updates: I moved to D.C. a few months ago, quit my old job, started working for the Treasury (specifically in benefits), and am now apartment hunting once again! 

In the course of apartment hunting, I started to realize just how much gentrification has occurred across the city over the last few decades. I wanted to visualize home prices in DC and how that's changed over time. I couldn't find an existing visualization of the block-by-block changes, so I guess this is a first-of-its-kind-view for the district. Hope it's as enlightening to you as it was to me - given that the DC primaries are coming up in a few weeks, I'm also planning to send this to a few mayoral/ward council candidates, in the hopes that they can commit to further rent/housing protections. 

Love,

Robin
